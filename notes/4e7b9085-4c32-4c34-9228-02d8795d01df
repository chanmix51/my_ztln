# Pomm Model Manager

This topic is about creating the new Model Manager for Pomm.
Pomm's Model Manger is the software that allows developers to interact between their data structures and the database.
The idea behind this is to make it easy for developers to shape their data directly from the database, using the power of PostgreSQL to do so.
There was already a Model Manager with Pomm 2 and even though it was great, there were features that either were not used or were not well suited for the job.

  - a Model class holds several queries generating often different sub classes of the same business entity
  - it is difficult to use projection for nested entities
  - the FlexibleContainer is almost never used

Using DDD approach
 - entities have to be agnostic and defined by the developer.
 - Query with its projection must be crafted one per class.
 - A projection can be embedded in another projection to nest entities.
